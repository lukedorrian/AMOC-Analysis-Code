# AMOC-Analysis-Code
Compilation of code to analyze model outputs of AMOC
First version does not require any pre-processing, requires U,V,S,Theta, and surface precip.,evap.,heat flux data.
V2 requires pre-processing via CDO to grid into the desired control area (North Atlantic) but runs much faster, also more friendly to inputting new models, with few changes required in the code

Feel free to use any of this code, with credit. I will upload a far more comprehensive outline for use in the future. Feel free to email me at ldorrian3@gatech.edu if you have any questions.
